## Files

### `template.html` — the entire app (HTML + CSS + JS, ~600 lines)
Built into `index.html`/`voyage-afrique.html` by `build.py`, which replaces
three literal tokens:
- `__DATA__`    ← contents of `data.json`
- `__PHOTOS__`  ← contents of `photos.json`
- `__GALLERY__` ← contents of `gallery.json` (`[]` if absent)

Layout: CSS grid `header / map / panel`. The timeline section (`.sec-tl`)
lives in the header on BOTH breakpoints (`header .sec-tl` compact grid:
date + play left, full-width scrub over the ticks); the panel only holds
legs + cars. Desktop: map left, 392 px panel right. **Mobile (≤880 px)**:
app-style split — fixed map on top (38vh), the panel becomes a rounded
bottom sheet with its own scroll and the cars section (`.sec-cars`)
reorders before the legs list (CSS `order`). The header wraps to two rows
(brand + stats, then date/play/scrub; tagline, pax stat and the ticks row
hidden); the seats grid stays 2 columns but the seat cards compact
(smaller padding/chip/fonts, 42 px HP bar). When zoomed out on mobile
(`body.danger-far`) the danger stickers shrink to 38 % (vs 62 % desktop)
and the deco camels hide entirely, so they don't bury the small map.

Key JS structures (all near the top of the script):
- `DATA.records` — one entry per day: `{date, iso, checkpoint, location,
  cap1, cap2, car1:{Name:state}, car2:{...}}`; states: `present | unknown |
  tentative | absent`.
- `DATA.config` — the parsed Config sheet tab; **all editorial content
  comes from it** (`CFG` in the JS): `textes` (titre — site name in the header/tab, tagline, foot,
  open-route labels), `checkpoints` (display names), `etapes` → `LEG_META`, `rpg` →
  `RPG`, `rpgVoitures` → `CAR_RPG`, `danger` → `DANGER`, `deco` (decorative stickers), `couleurs`.
  Fallbacks are minimal — edit the sheet, not the JS.
- `DATA.route` — polyline points `{lat,lng, cp?}` (Config `## route`);
  points with `cp` are checkpoints (SUISSE, MALAGA, ALGECIRAS, DAKHLA,
  DAKAR, CONAKRY, ABIDJAN, ACCRA, LOMÉ).
- `LEGS` — derived legs between checkpoints (`s`/`e` = record indices,
  `ri0`/`ri1` = route indices; last leg is the open-ended stay at Lomé).
- `LEG_META` — per-leg theme emoji + difficulty 1-5 + label (◆ pips,
  color-coded green/amber/red via `DIFF_COLOR`, hex on purpose: reused as
  SVG stroke on the map where `var()` doesn't work).
- `RPG` — per-traveler `{xp, pv, skill, lien, tel, note}` (PV bar color
  thresholds ≥7 green, ≥4 amber, else red), from the sheet's `## rpg`
  section (columns: nom, xp, pv, compétence, lien, téléphone, note).
  `lien` (optional URL) is NOT on the card any more — the card opens the
  fiche; the link lives there as the "Ouvrir le lien ↗" button.
- **Fiche aventurier** — clicking (tapping) any face chip REPLACES that
  person's car (or Observateurs) block in the panel with an in-place detail
  card (`ficheFor` state; `renderCar()`/`renderObs()` return `ficheHTML()`
  when the open name is in their roster — NOT a popup): big face, XP/PV/
  skill, embarkation/disembarkation + days aboard **derived from the
  presence grid** (`presenceOf()`, first/last present-or-tentative day;
  "route ouverte…" if still aboard at the end), plus Téléphone (`tel:` link)
  and Note rows when the sheet columns are filled, and a lien button.
  ✕ button or Escape closes (`closeFiche()`); the fiche survives day
  changes. On mobile the click handler also smooth-scrolls the opened
  `.fiche-card` to the center of the bottom sheet (it can open off-screen). While open, `ficheLine` (wide translucent polyline in the car's
  colour, `updateFicheLine()`, sent to back) highlights the person's
  stretch of the route between embarkation and disembarkation. The chip click is captured (capture:true) so it beats the
  card's `<a>`; hover-zoom stays desktop-only sugar, the tap IS the
  mobile gesture.
- `OBS` — `CFG.observateurs` (sheet `## observateurs`, `nom` column): people
  following from home. Rendered ONCE into `#obs`/`.sec-obs` as a car-style
  box (🛰️, khaki accent) of seat cards with state `observer`; stats + lien
  come from their row in the `## rpg` section (Giordano).
- `CAR_RPG` — same for the cars + a `malus` line with their real-world
  afflictions (car 1 wheel bearings, car 2 holed exhaust −700 CHF).
- `DANGER` — Sahel danger zones `{lat, lng, img:'terroN', s:size_px, r:radius_m,
  t:label}`; drawn as red dashed circles + sticker `<img>` + label. Zones are
  real advisory geography (France Diplomatie / ACLED): NE-Mauritania military
  zone, east-Mauritanian axes, north & central Mali, Liptako-Gourma
  tri-border, east Burkina, Lake Chad. Stickers are ethnically matched to the
  dominant makeup of the region's armed groups (Arab-looking north,
  Black-looking Sahel/Lake Chad). Labels hide + stickers scale to 62 % below
  zoom 5 (`body.danger-far`, `dangerZoom()`). Includes the South-Bamako /
  Guinea-axis zone (JNIM pushed south-west in 2025 to isolate Bamako).
- `CFG.deco` — decorative stickers `{lat, lng, img:'chameauN', s}` (Config
  `## deco`): camels along the desert stretch, plain `<img>` markers reusing
  `.danger-img` (drop-shadow + danger-far scaling), no circle/label.
- `LIVE` — living portraits (name → `{src, w, l, t}`): MP4 loops in
  `photos/videos/` (relative paths, see that folder's CLAUDE.md). The seat
  chip gets class `live`; delegated mouseover/mouseout toggle `.playing`
  (video plays inside the circle, replacing the hover-zoom img effect —
  the wrapper `.live-wrap` scales ×3.2 instead); the fiche face plays it
  continuously (autoplay muted loop). `oncanplay` adds `.vid-ok` so a
  missing/unloadable video falls back to the static photo.
- **Seat interaction** (`setPreview()`, `openFicheFor()`): clicking ANYWHERE
  on a seat card opens that person's fiche. On touch (`canHover` =
  `matchMedia('(hover:hover)')` is false) the chip alone is a two-step:
  1st tap = preview (`.preview` class: enlarged + video playing), 2nd tap =
  fiche; tapping outside cancels the preview. Hover CSS lives in
  `@media (hover:hover)` so touch devices never get stuck hover states,
  and the mouseover/mouseout handlers bail out when `canHover` is false.
- **Zoom-out on a face** (`faceMarkup()`, `liveZoom()`): hovering ANY face —
  seat chip or fiche portrait — enlarges it AND widens the framing. Live
  portraits widen their video's inline w/l/t (`liveZoom()`, head kept
  centered, clamped to the frame); static ones cross-fade to the `.f-wide`
  image from `PHOTOS.facesWide`. **Mobile has no hover**: tapping the
  fiche's portrait toggles `.wide`, which applies the same CSS — that's the
  touch equivalent (a chip tap is already taken: it opens the fiche).
- `PHOTOS` — `{faces:{Name:dataURI}, facesWide:{Name:dataURI}, cars:{1:…,2:…},
  terros:{terroN:…}, chameaux:{chameauN:…}}`. `facesWide` is the SAME crop
  1.9× wider (`WIDE` in make_faces.py): a chip is a pre-cropped JPEG, so
  without it there is nothing "around" to reveal on zoom.
  Faces render in seat chips (30 px circle, status-colored ring, hover zoom
  ×3.2 via `.seat-chip.photo:hover img`); all 10 travelers have one (a
  missing face would fall back to the initial letter).
- **Odomètre** (`odoSet()`, `.odo*` CSS): the header's km stat is a mechanical
  counter — one 0-9 reel per digit in a `overflow:hidden` window, rolled by
  `transform: translateY(calc(-N * var(--oh)))` with a CSS transition, so
  scrubbing makes the digits spin. `--oh` (cell height) is the single source
  of truth. Reels are rebuilt only when the number's *shape* changes
  (digit count / separators), then roll in from 0. Gotcha: the digits are
  `<span>`s inside `.stat`, so ALL THREE classes (`.odo-d`, `.odo-r`,
  `.odo-sep`) must override `.stat span` (9.5px, muted) — forgetting the
  reel alone silently shrinks everything it contains.
- Map rendering in `render()`: `traveled` orange polyline (+ glow) up to the
  convoy, `legLine` highlighting the ACTIVE leg (this is what makes a clicked
  leg visible — don't remove it) with animated dashes (`.leg-flow` CSS) and
  difficulty color, a floating `leg-chip` (emoji + label + pips) at the leg's
  mid-distance, numbered `cp-badge` milestones (done = orange fill, next
  destination pulses amber; name pills hide below zoom 5 via
  `body.danger-far`), pulsing convoy marker (amber "?" variant on the final
  stay leg with the "open route" circle).
- The Étapes list is a horizontal scroll-snap slider (`.legs`), ‹ › buttons
  (`#legs-prev/next`), and `render()` auto-scrolls the active card into view.
- **Clicking the route** jumps the timeline: `routeHit` is an invisible
  22 px-wide polyline over the whole route whose click handler finds the
  record index whose `posAt()` position is closest (equirectangular metric)
  and calls `setIndex()`. The numbered `cp-badge` circles are clickable too
  (jump to that checkpoint's arrival day; the name pill stays click-through).
- `GALLERY` — shared Drive photos `[{id, name, date(iso), lat, lng,
  gps(bool), thumb(dataURI), file}]` (see `fetch_photos.py`). Rendered by
  `rebuildBubbles()` (rerun on every zoomend): photos within ~42 screen px
  (30 when zoomed out) greedily merge into one `.bubble-wrap` pile — round
  thumb (34 px, sand border, 22 px when `body.danger-far`), offset discs
  behind (`.stacked`) and an orange `.bubble-count` badge. Clicking a pile
  opens the `#lightbox` slideshow over the cluster: ‹ › buttons + arrow
  keys navigate, caption shows date + "position estimée (convoi)" when
  `gps` is false + `k/n`. Image is `photos/uploads/<id>.jpg` (relative;
  `onerror` falls back to the embedded thumb so the standalone file
  works). Esc/click closes.

### `build.py`
Reads `template.html` + `data.json` + `photos.json` + `gallery.json`,
writes the two root HTML files. Trivial; run after ANY change to template
or JSON.

### `parse_csv.py`
`data/AfriqueCalendrier_-_Presences_Voyage.csv` (+ `data/Config.csv`, the
Config tab: `read_config()` parses its `## section` blocks) → `data.json`.
The `ROUTE`/`CAR_COLORS` constants are only fallbacks for a missing
Config.csv. Only needs rerunning when the CSVs change (usually via
`refresh.py`).

### `refresh.py`
Downloads the live Google Sheet as CSV (URL/ID from git-ignored
`.sheet-url`, or CLI arg) — both the presence grid and the Config tab
(`CONFIG_GID`) — then runs parse_csv + build in-process. The sheet must be
shared "anyone with link can view". Stdlib only.

### `sheet_edit.py`
CLI to read and **write** the live Google Sheet (`tabs`, `get "A1:E5"`,
`set "B3" value…`, `setrows "A10:C12" rows.json`, `clear "Z100"`; A1 ranges,
optional `Tab!` prefix, first tab by default). Auth is a Google Cloud
service account: JSON key in the git-ignored `.sheet-credentials.json` at
the repo root, sheet shared with the service-account email as Editor
(one-time setup steps in the docstring). Sheet ID comes from `.sheet-url`
like `refresh.py`. After sheet writes, run `refresh.py` to sync the site.

### `fetch_photos.py`
Syncs the shared Drive photo folder onto the map (`--dry-run` to preview).
Folder URL/ID in the git-ignored `.drive-folder` (same pattern as
`.sheet-url`); auth reuses `sheet_edit.load_key()`/`access_token()` with the
`drive.readonly` scope. For each NEW image (incremental via ids already in
`gallery.json`): downloads it, dates it (EXIF `DateTimeOriginal` → Drive
`imageMediaMetadata.time` → `createdTime`), locates it (EXIF GPS → Drive
location → **convoy position on that date**: `convoy_position()` is a Python
port of the template's `posAt()`/`legOf()` interpolation, plus a
deterministic ±0.12° `jitter()` seeded by the Drive id), then writes
`photos/uploads/<id>.jpg` (max 1600 px) + a 96 px square thumb as data URI
into `src/gallery.json`, and reruns `build.py`. Setup steps in the
docstring (share the folder with the service account as Viewer).

### `sync.py`
The user-facing one-shot updater (`python src/sync.py`, or `sync.bat` at the
root for double-click): refresh.py → fetch_photos.py → `git add` of an
explicit whitelist of pipeline outputs (never `photos/gal.enc`) → commit →
push. Exits without committing when nothing changed.

### `make_faces.py`
Produces `photos.json` + the generated image folders. **The source images
were removed from the working tree** (outputs are committed); the script
exits with restore instructions (`git checkout 20d79de -- photos/`) if they
are missing — see `photos/CLAUDE.md`. Three parts:
1. **Faces**: hand-tuned square crops via the `CROPS` dict (cx, cy, size as
   fractions; tweak these to reframe someone) → `photos/faces/<name>.jpg`,
   128 px. Several names can share one source file: `mugshots.jpeg` carries
   Edouard, Younous and Giordano (3 prison mugshots, left to right).
2. **Cars**: `cut_car()` crops the two cars out of `photos/voitures.jpg`
   (boxes in `CAR_BOXES`) and removes the FAKE painted checkerboard
   background by flood-filling light unsaturated pixels from the borders.
3. **Stickers**: `cut_stickers()` splits sticker sheets into individual RGBA
   stickers: background mask (`outside_mask`) → connected-component labeling
   on a 2× downscale (pure-python BFS, no scipy) → per-blob crop. Two sheets:
   `photos/terros.jpg` (grey fake-checkerboard bg) and `photos/chameaux.jpg`
   (plain white bg → `bg="white"` mask, `rows=4` ordering bands, quantized
   to 64-colour palette PNGs).

Hard-won gotchas (do not re-learn these):
- `Image.fromarray(np_array)` shares a **read-only** buffer —
  `ImageDraw.floodfill` writes are silently lost without `.copy()`.
- The checkerboard in `terros.jpg` spans greys **142–209** only. The
  background candidate is `saturation<20 AND 105<max<230`: the lower bound
  swallows the stickers' soft grey drop shadows (else they bridge neighbours
  into merged blobs), the upper bound **preserves the white sticker
  outlines** (eating them left muddy blend halos, e.g. old terro11 bug).
- Dilation before labeling is MaxFilter(5) on the 2× downscale ≈ merges
  gaps <8 px; bigger kernels merged adjacent stickers on the dense sheet.
- `CLEAN = {sticker_index: [fractional rects]}` erases sheet artifacts baked
  next to a sticker (currently terro7 and terro9). (A `defringe()` halo-peeler
  used to live here; it became unreachable once the white outlines were
  preserved, and was deleted — see git history if a sheet ever needs it.)

### `data.json` / `photos.json` / `gallery.json`
Generated. Never edit by hand; regenerate with the scripts above. All are
committed so a rebuild doesn't depend on the private sheet or Drive.
To remove a photo permanently, delete it from the Drive folder AND from
`gallery.json` + `photos/uploads/` (a sync re-adds any Drive file whose id
is missing from `gallery.json`).
